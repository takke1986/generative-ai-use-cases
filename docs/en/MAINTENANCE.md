# Maintenance Mode

Maintenance mode replaces the whole application with a notice, without redeploying.
Use it while you are working on the environment, or to stop people from starting new
work when costs need to be contained.

## Turning it on

The flag lives in a single file, `maintenance.json`, next to the built assets.

```bash
# Look up the distribution and the bucket that serve the web assets
WEB_URL=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name GenerativeAiUseCasesStack<env> \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`WebUrl`].OutputValue' --output text)
DISTRIBUTION_ID=$(aws cloudfront list-distributions \
  --query "DistributionList.Items[?DomainName=='${WEB_URL#https://}'].Id" --output text)
ORIGIN=$(aws cloudfront get-distribution --id "$DISTRIBUTION_ID" \
  --query 'Distribution.DistributionConfig.Origins.Items[0].DomainName' --output text)
BUCKET=${ORIGIN%%.s3.*}

# Turn maintenance mode on
echo '{"maintenance": true}' > /tmp/maintenance.json
aws s3 cp /tmp/maintenance.json "s3://$BUCKET/maintenance.json" \
  --content-type application/json
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id "$DISTRIBUTION_ID" \
  --paths /maintenance.json
```

The invalidation is required. The default cache policy keeps the file at the edge for up
to a day, so overwriting the object alone is not enough.

You can add a message that is shown instead of the default text:

```json
{ "maintenance": true, "message": "Back at 10:00 JST" }
```

## Turning it off

```bash
echo '{"maintenance": false}' > /tmp/maintenance.json
aws s3 cp /tmp/maintenance.json "s3://$BUCKET/maintenance.json" \
  --content-type application/json
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id "$DISTRIBUTION_ID" \
  --paths /maintenance.json
```

## How it behaves

- The flag is fetched when the application starts, every 60 seconds after that, and
  whenever the tab becomes visible again. Open tabs therefore switch over on their own.
- **Any failure is treated as "not under maintenance".** A single failed request should
  not lock everyone out, so a network error, a non-200 response or a body that is not
  JSON all leave the application usable.
- The flag is a `.json` on purpose. The service worker precache only covers
  `js`, `css`, `html`, `ico`, `png` and `svg`, so this request always reaches the network
  instead of being served from the cache of an already installed PWA.

## Limitations

Maintenance mode stops the user interface, not the API. Someone who calls the API
directly is unaffected, so treat it as a notice rather than as an enforcement mechanism.
If you need to guarantee that no request reaches the model - to cap spend, for example -
block the API as well, for instance with an AWS WAF rule on the API.
